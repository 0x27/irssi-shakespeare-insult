# irssi-shakespeare-insult
Shakespearean Insult generator script for IRSSI IRC client.

You will need to have irssi-python installed, which is a MASSIVE FUCKING PAIN IN THE ARSE TO COMPILE, so I only tested it on Arch. 

To install, after nearly shooting yourself in the face during the compiling hell that is irssi-python, just move shakespeare.py to ~/.irssi/scripts and add "py load shakespeare" to your ~/.irssi/startup somewhere after "load python".

To use, just do /shakespeare to insult no one in particular (the open query window), or /shakespeare <nick> to insult a specific user in the current channel.
